## Implemented Features

- Sleep Sync Mode

Sleep Sync Mode let users input personal errands, events, or commitments. Based on this schedule, SleepSync intelligently recommends nap windows and sleep patterns that align with the user’s lifestyle and circadian rhythm.

- Wind-Down Mode

Wind-Down Mode offers a calming, structured experience designed to help users transition smoothly into sleep. It features three restorative tools: guided breathing exercises to reduce tension and regulate the nervous system, a journaling space for logging thoughts and moods to promote emotional clarity, and a sleep countdown timer that visually prepares the mind and body for rest.

- Mood Checker

Mood Checker  lets users select or log their current mood and display it in a container called Selected Mood (happy, sad, angry, tired , and dizzy).

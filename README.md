# SleepSync

SleepSync is a mobile wellness app designed to help users optimize their sleep cycles and improve daily energy through personalized tracking, smart scheduling, and guided wind-down routines. SleepSync has two main features: the sleep sync mode and wind-down mode.

## Sleep Sync Mode
lets users input personal errands, events, or commitments. Based on this schedule, SleepSync intelligently recommends nap windows and sleep patterns that align with the user’s lifestyle and circadian rhythm.

## Wind-Down Mode
offers a calming, structured experience designed to help users transition smoothly into sleep. It features three restorative tools: guided breathing exercises to reduce tension and regulate the nervous system, a journaling space for logging thoughts and moods to promote emotional clarity, and a sleep countdown timer that visually prepares the mind and body for rest.
